        question: "Is it possible to offer gift certificates and packages?",
        answer: "Yes! High-tier Acuity plans allow you to sell gift certificates, subscription packages, and discount codes directly through your booking page."

    {
        question: "Can I integrate my existing intake forms?",
        answer: "We recreate your intake forms directly within Acuity, allowing you to collect all necessary client information at the moment of booking."
