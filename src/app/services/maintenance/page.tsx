        question: "What exactly is included in Squarespace website management?",
        answer: "Our management services cover everything from content updates and image swaps to technical monitoring, security checks, and platform updates. We ensure your site stays current, functional, and secure without you lifting a finger."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I request content updates at any time?",
        answer: "Yes! Depending on your plan, you can send us your content updates (text, images, blog posts, products) and we'll handle the implementation within a guaranteed turnaround time, typically 24-48 hours."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you handle Squarespace platform updates?",
        answer: "Squarespace updates its platform regularly. We monitor these changes to ensure your site's custom code and design remain compatible and bug-free after any backend updates."
    },
    {
        question: "Is technical support included?",
        answer: "Absolutely. If something stops working or you encounter a technical glitch, we're your first point of contact. We troubleshoot and fix issues directly within the Squarespace environment."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I cancel my maintenance plan at any time?",
        answer: "We offer flexible monthly and annual plans. You can cancel or change your plan at the end of your billing cycle with no hidden fees or long-term lock-ins."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you provide reports on my website's performance?",
        answer: "Yes, our premium plans include monthly health and performance reports, giving you insights into your site's traffic, security status, and any optimizations we've performed."
    },
    {
        question: "What if I need a completely new feature added to my site?",
        answer: "Small features are often covered under maintenance. For larger structural changes or new page builds, we offer discounted rates for our active maintenance clients."
