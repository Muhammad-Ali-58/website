    title: 'Built for Real Products, Not Just Demos',
    description: "We focus on software that runs in production and stays there. Our team builds systems that are stable, maintainable, and designed for real users, not one time launches.\n\n From early MVPs to mature platforms, we think through architecture, data flow, and long term usage before writing code. That is why the products we ship continue to run, evolve, and scale.",

    title: 'Strong Engineering, Clear Ownership',
    description: "Every project has clear technical ownership. You work directly with engineers who understand the system end to end and take responsibility for decisions.\n\n This reduces miscommunication, rework, and delays. You get steady progress, realistic timelines, and honest answers when tradeoffs are needed.",

    title: 'AI Where It Makes Sense, Not Everywhere',
    description: "We work deeply with AI systems, agents, and automation, but we apply them carefully. AI is used when it adds value, not because it sounds impressive.\n\n Whether it is an AI powered workflow or a traditional application, the goal stays the same. Solve the problem cleanly and keep the system understandable for the team running it.",

    title: 'Flexible Teams That Fit Your Stage',
    description: "Our engagement models are designed to adapt as your needs change. Start lean, scale up, or bring in senior engineers when complexity increases.\n\n Many teams work with us long term because the setup stays flexible without losing quality or continuity.",
